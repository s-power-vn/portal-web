# Active Context

## Current Focus Areas

### Expression Editor Component

#### Recent Changes & Improvements

1. Layout Structure

- Implemented flexible layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Grid structure: `grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_2fr_auto]` for main row layout
- Consistent gap spacing using `gap-4` between fields and `gap-1` for field internals
- Removed fixed heights to allow dynamic content sizing

2. Validation Messages

- Added inline validation messages with `text-xs` size
- Messages positioned directly under respective fields
- Conditional rendering of operator validation based on field visibility
- Error messages styled with `text-red-500` for consistency

3. Date Range Handling

- Implemented special handling for datetime 'IN' operator
- Two-column layout for date range inputs using flex
- Separate validation for fromDate and toDate fields

4. Component Structure

- Property Field: Base field with property selection
- Operator Field: Conditionally rendered based on property selection
- Value Field: Dynamic rendering based on property type and operator
- Remove Button: Consistently positioned with trash icon

#### Current Focus

1. Validation Logic

- Property selection validation
- Operator validation (only shown when operator field is visible)
- Value validation based on property type
- Date range validation for 'IN' operator

2. UI/UX Improvements

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Responsive error message display
- Smooth field transitions

#### Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring validation message positioning
2. Consider adding tooltips for complex operators
3. Evaluate need for additional validation rules
4. Consider adding field-level help text

### Database Security Implementation

#### Recent Changes & Improvements

1. Row Level Security

   - Enabled RLS on all database tables
   - Implemented organization-based data isolation
   - Created role hierarchy (anon -> org_admin)
   - Added JWT-based authentication

2. Access Control

   - Implemented role-based policies
   - Created helper functions for JWT claims
   - Set up organization context management
   - Added special case handling for key tables

3. Policy Implementation
   - SELECT policies for data visibility
   - INSERT/UPDATE policies with role checks
   - DELETE policies with elevated privileges
   - Special policies for organizations table

#### Current Focus

1. Security Testing

   - Policy validation
   - Role permission verification
   - Cross-organization isolation testing
   - JWT claim validation

2. Performance Optimization
   - Policy execution efficiency
   - Query optimization with RLS
   - JWT claim extraction caching

#### Next Steps

1. Comprehensive security testing
2. Performance impact assessment
3. Documentation updates
4. User role management implementation

## Current Focus

### Expression Editor Improvements

- Fixed operator parsing and display for datetime fields
- Enhanced form validation to only show after first submit
- Improved UX with sequential field display:
  - Property select is always visible
  - Operator select shows only after property is selected
  - Value input shows only after operator is selected
- Added proper spacing between multiple expressions
- Fixed date parsing and formatting in the expression editor

### Database Security Implementation

- Implemented comprehensive Row Level Security
- Set up role-based access control
- Created organization-based data isolation
- Added JWT-based authentication

## Recent Changes

- Updated expression editor's validation behavior to be less intrusive
- Improved the visual hierarchy of expression inputs
- Fixed bug with datetime operator parsing
- Implemented database security with Row Level Security
- Created role hierarchy and access policies
- Added JWT-based authentication
- Set up organization-based data isolation

## Next Steps

- Consider adding field-level validation states
- Consider adding animation for sequential field display
- Add more comprehensive testing for expression parsing
- Conduct comprehensive security testing
- Assess performance impact of RLS
- Implement user role management
- Document security patterns and policies

## Active Decisions

- Form validation errors only show after first submit attempt
- Fields appear sequentially to guide user input
- Maintain fixed height with scrollable content for multiple expressions
- Use Row Level Security for data isolation
- Implement role-based access control
- Use JWT claims for context
- Enable organization-based isolation

## Active Considerations

1. Code Organization

   - Maintain clean project structure
   - Follow established patterns
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns

2. Development Practices

   - Enforce TypeScript best practices
   - Follow React Query Kit pattern
   - Maintain consistent coding style

3. Documentation

   - Keep Memory Bank updated
   - Document new features and changes
   - Track progress and decisions

4. Security
   - Policy effectiveness
   - Performance impact
   - Role management
   - Cross-organization isolation
