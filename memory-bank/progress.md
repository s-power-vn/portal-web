- Infinite scrolling for project list
- Project detail view scaffolding
- Project settings page
- Issue badge for project status indication

### Database Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Role-based access control implementation
- JWT-based authentication
- Organization-based data isolation
- Helper functions for JWT claims extraction

### Error Handling

- Consistent error structure
- Vietnamese translation of all error messages
- Standardized error message patterns
- Clear error categories

## Pending Items

- Improve overall responsive design
- Enhance form validation experience

### Performance Optimization

- Evaluate RLS performance impact
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize API queries
- Review virtualization implementation
- Address potential bottlenecks

## Known Issues

- RLS policies may impact query performance
- Limited error handling in some components
- Some API endpoints missing comprehensive validation
- No comprehensive loading states implemented
- Some virtualization edge cases not fully handled
- Form validation needs improvement in certain areas
