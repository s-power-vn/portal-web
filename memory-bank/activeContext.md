# Active Context

## Current Focus Areas

### Expression Editor Component

#### Recent Changes & Improvements
1. Layout Structure
- Implemented flexible layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Grid structure: `grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_2fr_auto]` for main row layout
- Consistent gap spacing using `gap-4` between fields and `gap-1` for field internals
- Removed fixed heights to allow dynamic content sizing

2. Validation Messages
- Added inline validation messages with `text-xs` size
- Messages positioned directly under respective fields
- Conditional rendering of operator validation based on field visibility
- Error messages styled with `text-red-500` for consistency

3. Date Range Handling
- Implemented special handling for datetime 'IN' operator
- Two-column layout for date range inputs using flex
- Separate validation for fromDate and toDate fields

4. Component Structure
- Property Field: Base field with property selection
- Operator Field: Conditionally rendered based on property selection
- Value Field: Dynamic rendering based on property type and operator
- Remove Button: Consistently positioned with trash icon

#### Current Focus
1. Validation Logic
- Property selection validation
- Operator validation (only shown when operator field is visible)
- Value validation based on property type
- Date range validation for 'IN' operator

2. UI/UX Improvements
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Responsive error message display
- Smooth field transitions

#### Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring validation message positioning
2. Consider adding tooltips for complex operators
3. Evaluate need for additional validation rules
4. Consider adding field-level help text

## Current Focus

### Expression Editor Improvements

- Fixed operator parsing and display for datetime fields
- Enhanced form validation to only show after first submit
- Improved UX with sequential field display:
  - Property select is always visible
  - Operator select shows only after property is selected
  - Value input shows only after operator is selected
- Added proper spacing between multiple expressions
- Fixed date parsing and formatting in the expression editor

## Recent Changes

- Updated expression editor's validation behavior to be less intrusive
- Improved the visual hierarchy of expression inputs
- Fixed bug with datetime operator parsing

## Next Steps

- Consider adding field-level validation states
- Consider adding animation for sequential field display
- Add more comprehensive testing for expression parsing

## Active Decisions

- Form validation errors only show after first submit attempt
- Fields appear sequentially to guide user input
- Maintain fixed height with scrollable content for multiple expressions

## Active Considerations

1. Code Organization
   - Maintain clean project structure
   - Follow established patterns
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns

2. Development Practices
   - Enforce TypeScript best practices
   - Follow React Query Kit pattern
   - Maintain consistent coding style

3. Documentation
   - Keep Memory Bank updated
   - Document new features and changes
   - Track progress and decisions
