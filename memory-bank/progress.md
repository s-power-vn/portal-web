# Progress Report

## What Works
- Expression Editor core functionality
  - Property selection
  - Operator selection based on property type
  - Value input based on operator and property type
  - Date range support for datetime fields
  - Condition string parsing and generation
  - Form validation with delayed display
  - Sequential field display
  - Multiple expressions support with proper spacing

## Recent Improvements
- Fixed operator parsing bug in expression editor
- Enhanced form validation UX
  - Validation only shows after first submit
  - Real-time validation after first submit
- Improved expression editor UX
  - Sequential field display
  - Better spacing between expressions
  - Scrollable container for multiple expressions
- Fixed datetime handling in expressions
  - Proper parsing of ISO strings
  - Correct operator mapping
  - Date range support

## Known Issues
- Need more comprehensive testing for expression parsing
- Consider adding animations for sequential display
- Consider adding field-level validation states

## Next Steps
- Add more test coverage
- Consider UX improvements
  - Field animations
  - Loading states
  - Error state transitions
- Documentation updates
  - Usage examples
  - Common patterns
  - Best practices
