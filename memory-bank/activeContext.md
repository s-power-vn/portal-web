# Active Context

## Current Focus

### Expression Editor Improvements

- Fixed operator parsing and display for datetime fields
- Enhanced form validation to only show after first submit
- Improved UX with sequential field display:
  - Property select is always visible
  - Operator select shows only after property is selected
  - Value input shows only after operator is selected
- Added proper spacing between multiple expressions
- Fixed date parsing and formatting in the expression editor

## Recent Changes

- Updated expression editor's validation behavior to be less intrusive
- Improved the visual hierarchy of expression inputs
- Fixed bug with datetime operator parsing

## Next Steps

- Consider adding field-level validation states
- Consider adding animation for sequential field display
- Add more comprehensive testing for expression parsing

## Active Decisions

- Form validation errors only show after first submit attempt
- Fields appear sequentially to guide user input
- Maintain fixed height with scrollable content for multiple expressions
