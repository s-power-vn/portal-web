### Organization Management

Ongoing improvements to organization management, including:

- Role-based access control implementation
- Member management
- Organization settings
- Data isolation between organizations

### Database Security Implementation

Recent focus on implementing comprehensive database security:

- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Role-based access policies
- JWT-based authentication
- Organization-based data isolation

### API Error Handling & Localization

Error handling improvements have been a focus area:

- Consistent error structure in Vietnamese
- Standardized error message format
- Proper error propagation
- Clear user feedback

- Added issue badge component to show issue count
- Implemented customer association

### Database Security

- Implemented comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS)
- Set up role hierarchy (anon â†’ org_admin)
- Created organization-based data isolation
- Added JWT-based authentication
- Implemented helper functions for JWT claims

### UI Improvements

- Enhanced table components with virtualization
- Added proper loading indicators
- Implemented responsive layouts for all views
